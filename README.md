This directory contains the models for the structure of the phoq homodimer,
using cysteine crosslinking and 2-state bayesian modeling.

solution_ensemble:      all the 2-state models within the same cluster of similar structures
                        each model is made of two structures, labeled by number 1 and 2
localization_densities: all the calculated localization densities, for given domains, and for the
                        two states.
ucsf_chimera_files:     files used to generate the figures in the paper.
