This directory contains the models for the structure of the phoq homodimer,
using cysteine crosslinking and 2-state bayesian modeling.

_solution_ensemble:_
all the 2-state models within the same cluster of similar structures
each model is made of two structures, labeled by number 1 and 2

_localization_densities:_
all the calculated localization densities, for given domains, and for the
two states.

_ucsf_chimera_files:_
files used to generate the figures in the paper.

_modeling:_ scripts for modeling the system:

 - 2Y20_MC_1_FULL 1-state modelling
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL_90_PERCENT_DATA_1 2-state modeling with 90% data lackknifing
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL_95_PERCENT_DATA_1 2-state modeling with 95% data lackknifing
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL_template directory with all needed running scripts
 - 2Y20_MC_3_FULL 3-state modeling
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL 2-state modeling
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL_90_PERCENT_DATA_2 2-state modeling with 90% data lackknifing
 - 2Y20_MC_2_FULL_95_PERCENT_DATA_2 2-state modeling with 95% data lackknifing
