This directory contains the models for the structure of the phoq homodimer,
using cysteine crosslinking and 2-state bayesian modeling.

_solution_ensemble:_
all the 2-state models within the same cluster of similar structures
each model is made of two structures, labeled by number 1 and 2

_localization_densities:_
all the calculated localization densities, for given domains, and for the
two states.

_ucsf_chimera_files:_
files used to generate the figures in the paper.
